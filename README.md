# tic-tac-toe-
tic-tac-toe game with 1 and 2 player modes made in Python with Tkinter GUI library.
tic-tac-toe offers 1 and 2 player modes. In 1 player mode, the player can choose between normal and hard modes. In normal mode, the AI is randomly selecting places on the board. In hard mode, the AI attempts to find a path that will let it win otherwise it will block the player's path. If the AI cannot win or block the player's path, it will choose a random place on the board. 2 player mode is locally played with each player receiving their own token to use on the board.
